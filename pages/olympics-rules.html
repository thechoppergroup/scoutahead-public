General</strong>. There are two ways to play. One objective of the Promotion is to accumulate the most points by correctly selecting the "winning pick" for each of the event surveys associated with the Games. The event surveys are based on the outcome of the Games. There will be prizes based on making the most winning picks overall. The second objective of the Promotion is to invite the most new people who register to become Scoutahead.com users (&ldquo;<strong>Referrals</strong>&rdquo;).</p><p><strong>b. How to make your selections.&nbsp;</strong>You may enter your selections online by following the instructions as to how to play. In general, you must fill out a survey corresponding to an event (or multiple events) in the Games (e.g., &ldquo;Which country&rsquo;s athlete will win the 100m dash?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Will any athlete win five or more events?&rdquo;).</p><p><strong>c. Scoring</strong>. When your pick in a survey matches the winner of the event (or series of events), you will be awarded the number of points indicated on the survey. When a survey does not specify a number of points to be awarded, correct selections are worth 1 point.</p><p>In the event the Games or an event or category does not occur as scheduled (e.g., due to cancellation) no points will be awarded. If a single event that is part of a multi-event category (e.g., pick the winners of five different events) does not occur as scheduled, then the category shall be scored based on the results of the other events in the category.</p><p><strong>d. Lock-time.&nbsp;</strong>All picks will lock at the time noted on each survey, typically at midnight prior to the first event scheduled in each Games event survey or group of surveys (to the extent they are grouped). Your picks for the matchups must be submitted, received and recorded by the stated lock time. Selections submitted after the deadline are considered invalid. Sponsor's computer is the official time-keeping device for this Promotion.</p><p><strong>e</strong>. <strong>Referrals</strong>.

Each person invited using that process will receive an email with a unique sign-up link. When a person who is invited clicks on that link and then registers for Scoutahead.com, then the Entrant who invited that person shall be deemed to have accrued one &ldquo;Referral&rdquo;. Sponsor, in its sole discretion, shall determine how many Referrals each Entrant has generated.</p><p><strong>f. Limit.</strong>&nbsp;ONE (1) ENTRYPER PERSON/ PER UNIQUE SCOUTAHEAD.COM USER ACCOUNT (REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF EMAIL ADDRESSES OR REGISTERED MEMBER ACCOUNTS).</p><ol><li value="6"><strong>NO ENTRY FEE.&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>There is no entry fee required to participate in the Promotion.
