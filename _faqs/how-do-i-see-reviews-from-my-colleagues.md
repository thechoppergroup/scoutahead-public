title: How do I see reviews from my colleagues?
order: 11
---


Once you have received three reviews from your colleagues we provide you with the opportunity to see your individual composite review using the “Personal Scores” tab under Scout. This lets you see how all of your colleagues collectively have reviewed you using the same criteria that you used in your self-evaluation. Your colleagues’ individual reviews always remain anonymous. What you will see is a weighted average of all of your colleagues combined reviews. &nbsp;This protects each user’s privacy and allows for more honest input.
