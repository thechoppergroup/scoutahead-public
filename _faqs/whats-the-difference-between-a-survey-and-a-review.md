A review is designed to help individuals gather confidential insight about themselves from people they trust.

A survey is a questionnaire designed to gather information about any topic from a particular group of people.

Scoutahead surveys are flexible, and the survey creator has control over *who&nbsp;*can participate, *who&nbsp;*can see the results, *who&nbsp;*can create questions, and *what* types of questions are asked. A survey can be about anything. Reviews are designed to help individual people grow.
