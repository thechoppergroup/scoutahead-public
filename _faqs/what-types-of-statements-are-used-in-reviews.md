title: What types of statements are used in reviews?
order: '9'
---


For reviews, we use two kinds of evaluative statements: those for job-specific tasks and general traits.

The job-specific task statements are selected by you. When you identify your occupation, Scoutahead enables you to select from a list the job-specific tasks that best fit what you do in your job. We then turn those into job-specific tasks into evaluation statements for your colleagues to use when providing you a review.

The general traits statements have been prepared by psychologists and business executives. These relate to attitudes, preferences, and behaviors that are personally and interpersonally relevant to the workplace overall.
