title: How are Personal Scores generated?
order: 13
---


Personal Scores are generated by calculating a weighted average of your colleagues' collective reviews. Your self-evaluation scores are available immediately. You will see scores based on peer reviews only after three people have reviewed you. You will never see how another user individually rated you, for either a category or a specific statement. Individual reviews always remain anonymous. This protects each userâ€™s privacy and allows for more honest input.
