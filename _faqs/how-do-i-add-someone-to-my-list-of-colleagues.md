title: How do I add someone to my list of Colleagues?
order: '41'

If you search for someone and find them on Scoutahead, you will see their profile. On their profile page, you can choose to “Connect with [colleague name].”

Another way is through suggested colleagues or incoming colleague requests. Both options show up on your Colleagues page. You will see someone’s name and an icon to add them to your Colleagues list. Choose “Connect” to add them.
