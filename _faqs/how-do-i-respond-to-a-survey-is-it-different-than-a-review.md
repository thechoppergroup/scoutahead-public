title: How do I respond to a survey? Is it different than a review?
order: 4

When youâ€™re responding to a survey, you will be asked to either answer questions or determine how strongly you agree with a given statement. Most of the time, you will be able to provide an answer along a spectrum of responses (e.g., from strongly disagree to strongly agree). Sometimes, you may be asked a simple yes/no question with only two options for a response. Unlike in a review, the survey creator chooses the types of allowable responses.
