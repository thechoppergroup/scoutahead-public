title: How do I control whose reviews count?
order: 7

For anyone’s review to be included in composite review results, both you and the person who is reviewing you must indicate:

* That you actually know each other
* How you know each other
* How well you believe that person can review you


For example, if Bob says he was Mary’s manager at Company XYZ, but Mary says she does not know Bob, then Bob’s review of Mary will not count in Mary’s composite reviews.&nbsp;
