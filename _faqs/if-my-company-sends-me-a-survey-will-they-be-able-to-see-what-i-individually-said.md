No. We donâ€™t share individual survey responses with anyone, even companies. Scoutahead operates under the assumption that the most honest, accurate information is provided only when people trust their individual responses are private.

Survey creators can see the aggregate results from all survey participants, as well as how many participants have completed the survey. Scoutahead does not tell survey creators which participants have completed the survey.
