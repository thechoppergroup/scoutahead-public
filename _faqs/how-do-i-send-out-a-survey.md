For all surveys you create, weâ€™ll create a unique web link that you can distribute to anyone you want to take the survey.

Only people authorized to participate will be able to see your survey, even with the link. If you create a public survey, however, anyone can respond if they have the link to your survey.

If you specify a Group of people that can participate in your survey, your survey will show up in their Scoutahead home page.
