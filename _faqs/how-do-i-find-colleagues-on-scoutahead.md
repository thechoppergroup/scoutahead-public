order: '40'

We offer several ways for you to connect with friends, teammates, classmates, and other people you know.

If you have a particular person in mind, you can search for them if they are already part of the Scoutahead community. If they aren’t yet on Scoutahead, you can let us know and we’ll invite them.

You can also look through the connections of people in your Scoutahead network. This is a great way to reconnect with colleagues.
