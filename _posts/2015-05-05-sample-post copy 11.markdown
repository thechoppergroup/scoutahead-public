This framework is built on Jekyll and Angular. Its a simple single page application that leverages the speed of Jekyll static rendering with angular's front end capabilities. Parts like the menu are generated my Jekyll but each page is serve by Angular. 

In order to prevent conflicts between liquid templating and angular the use of the curly brakes is swapped  out for double square brackets.
