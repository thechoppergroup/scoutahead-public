What Cognitive and Organizational Psychologists have known for decades is that real investment is driven by internal motivation more than external reinforcement.  If people believe they’re doing something because they genuinely want to do it, they’ll simply be more committed to doing what they are doing.  This is essential in the workplace.  Externally, a positive and strategic environment is necessary to provide employees the opportunity to invest in themselves.   But long-term motivation in growth and work ultimately comes from the employees’ belief that the accomplishments are for themselves, not for their managers or a paycheck.

Scoutahead’s platform promotes internally driven growth by engaging employees in their own review criteria, and providing them the opportunity to get private feedback about themselves from co-workers using that criteria prior to their formal review.  With this information, employees are more motivated to improve on their own terms, knowing all they need to know for themselves to become stronger in their work.  Moreover, they are positively engaged in a review process that gives them more control of their performance and their future.
