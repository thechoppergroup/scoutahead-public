				<div class="editable">
	        <ul>
	          <li>
	            Only you see your feedback - not your boss, not your peers, and not the public.
	          </li>
	          <li>
	            You have complete control over whose reviews count.
	          </li>
	          <li>
	            You receive more accurate feedback: Reviewers can be completely honest because you will only see aggregated scores from multiple reviewers, never their individual responses.
	          </li>
	          <li>
	            We use evaluation criteria developed by workplace and psychology experts that provide the most relevant information. Our criteria will evolve to allow respected professionals in every field to improve the questions asked in their specific occupations.
